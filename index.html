        <b>Remember: Everybody hates me. My family, my friends, my coworkers, the Brazilians, the north Americans, everybody hates me.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Mainly the Freemasons hate me. Be extra careful with the Freemason that approaches my life.</b>
        <br>

        <H3>Man in the Shack</H3>

        <b>The only clue I have is: The United States of America is hateful against Brazil. Brazil got an incredible mind, forced upon him a mortal/incapacitating disease and put him to collect garbage. The incredible mind is me Marcelo Costa Toyama</b>

        </ul>

        <b>As it is, I am the <i>Man in the Shack + Endless</i> forever.</b>

        The voices in my head said that a world controller runs a region until his 40th birthday. Nevertheless, because of what Brazil has done to me, I will be the World Controller of region Brazil until my death day. Even If I am abroad, even If i am in a psychiatric hospital.
        <br>
        The voices in my head said that I live my life backwards. I was born old and I am getting younger. Because of that I will be the World Controller of Brazil region until my death day.

        <H3>I Fought the Law</H3>
        <b>I will never have a fair judgment. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life. My <u>descendants</u> will never have a fair judgment also. Neither in the freemasonry, neither in the human life.</b>

        <ul>
            <li>Always destroy any wish that is not selfish</li>
            <li>Never go back to freemasonry.</li>
        </ul>

        <H3>What I know about the enemy - Mental States</H3>
        There is information in my mind that unlocks given my conscious and subconscious choices.
        <br>
        There is going to never stop the leaking of information from my mind.
        <br>
        The information leaking depend on situations. If I am in a Justice Court is one kind of information, if I am in a Freemason lodge it is another kind of information, if I am in a doctor office is another kind of information.
        The information only leaks If I am in the situation, if it is another personality there is no leaking of information.
        <br>
        When someone gives an order and the alter yells "free will violation", it is very difficult for me to obtain the memory.
        <br>
        The information only leaks when I am in the situation by my own free-will, If I am hypnotised obyeing orders, there is no leak of information.

        <H3>Keeping my promise</H3>
        I don't have any promises to keep. But a lesson for the future: <i>It is easier to keep your promise, when your word is to no do something instead of do something.</i>

        <H3>What I know about the enemy - Desires about money</H3>
        Desires about money always backfire. Desires about how debt is paid, always backfire.

        <H3>Make them break their promises</H3>
        All my life is written, until my death day.
        <br>
        It is up to me to make theses religious bastards break their promises.

        <blockquote>
            The goal of freemasonry is to teach man about himself.
            <br>
            Freemasonry gives the man what he desires, make him regret about this and ask GADU for forgiveness.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            The objective of the faith test is to be a Freemason. The faith test is never over.
            <br>
            <b>The only way to end the faith test is to put yourself on the Black Book.</b>
        </blockquote>

        <H3>Black Book</H3>
        The black book is a book with the names of all masons that are banished from Freemasonry. To have your name written in the <b>black book</b> is the only way to end your <i>faith test.</i>

        <H3>Great Architect, Three Headed Satan, God</H3>
        <i>There are many religions, there are many masonic rites, but the Great Architect, the Three Headed Satan and God are always the same.</i>
        <blockquote>
            <i>Great Architect</i> - is the Freemason that has the plan to manipulate the God and the neophyte's faith test. He is always a Freemason from Heaven.
            <br>
            <i>Three Headed Satan</i> - is the Freemason that rules if the faith test is fair. He is always a Freemason from Hell that is a law enforcement officer in the real world and in the Freemasonry world, like a judge, prosecutor or a lawyer.
            <br>
            <i>God</i> - is the powerful Political person that destroys the neophyte life using God's religion.
        </blockquote>

        <H3>Ark of the Covenant</H3>
        The Ark of Covenant is the agreement between God and his followers.
        <br>
        <b>The neophyte is never a follower of God.</b>
        <br>
        <b>The freemasons are never followers of God</b>
        <br>
        God write events to happen on the neophyte life. These events should be meaningful. Either spiritually, mentally or materially.
        <br>
        The followers of God must fulfill the Ark of Covenant in the neophyte's life.
        <br>
        During the events, the neophyte must exercise his most precious gift <b>free-will</b>. And interpreted the events according to the religion of the neophyte.
        <br>
        The neophyte must fulfill the prophecy book by <b>acting</b> on the events and choosing between virtue and sin.

        <blockquote>
            God and the followers of God are never freemasons.
            <br>
            <b>Hell are the freemasons.</b>
        </blockquote>

        <H3>Book of Job</H3>
        The Book of Job from Bible is the faith test.

        <ul>
            <li>God decides how the life of the neophyte is destroyed and reconstructed. See <b>Ark of Covenant</b></li>
            <li>Hell profits with the destruction of neophyte's life. Debts in the real world are made in the name of the neophyte.</li>
            <li>Heaven prevents the worst.</li>
            <li>God demands virtue.</li>
            <li>Hell gives rewards for sins.</li>
            <li>Hell decides that the test is over. This date is marked by the neophyte becoming a master freemason</li>
            <li>Heaven profits with the reconstruction of the neophyte's life. The Debts in the real world are payed to the neophyte.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>In this process the neophyte must choose between good and evil. This will show to the neophyte his true nature</b>

        <H3>V.I.T.R.I.O.L</H3>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Visita Interiora Terrae, Rectificando, Invenies Occultum Lapidem</b>

            <i>Visit the interior of the earth and purifying you will find the hidden stone.</i>
        </blockquote>
        <b>It means reconciliation. During the faith test, the neophyte makes wrong decisions and argue/fight with his beloveds one. At the end, there must be a reconciliation.</b>

        <H3>Religious War</H3>
        The faith test is always a religious war. It is a war of the God's religion and the neophyte's religion.
        <br>
        <b>To the neophyte is a religious experience. He must be faithful to his own religion, not the God's religion.</b>
        <br>
        To everyone else, God, the Freemasons, the future lodge, is a power game.
        <br>
        It is a hidden war between the God and the Freemasons. And the Freemasons profit destroying and saving the life of the neophyte.

        <H3>Power game</H3>
        God thinks that is only powerful person playing and is teaching a game of power to the neophyte with the excuse of knowing if he is good or evil.
        God destroys the life of the neophyte and demands conversion to his religion.
        God thinks that he is alone playing the game. In truth, God is playing a power game against the freemasonry.
        <br>
        For everyone involved is a power game.
        <br>
        <b>For the neophyte, it is a religious experience.</b> The neophyte life is destroyed and God demands virtue. For the neophyte, MUST be a story about justice.

        <H4>Never obey God's religion</H4>
        If the neophyte obeys the God's religion, it is the worst scenario as possible.
        <br>
        God will destroy the neophyte's life and will demand virtue.
        If the neophyte is virtuous, God will lose and he will not know why. So, he will destroy the neophyte's life again and again to see who are the Freemasons who are profiting with the God's loses.
        <br>

        <br>
        They are usually past worshipful masters.

        <H3>Heaven, Hell and the Worshipful Master</H3>
        When a Master mason becomes a Worshipful Master, he can choose to stay in Heaven or go to Hell.
        <br>
        If the Worshipful Master is a powerful, influent and rich person, he usually chooses to stay in Heaven. He thinks: - I, alone, am powerful and rich. I don't need anybody else.
        <br>
        If the Worshipful Master is not a powerful, influent and rich person, he chooses to go to Hell. He thinks: - I want to fly higher. I need friends. I must make a commitment with Hell.
        <br>
        <b>That is the difference from Worshipful Master from Heaven and Hell.</b>
        <br>
        Each Worshipful Master from Heaven thinks - I don need anybody else.
        <br>
        Each Worshipful Master from Hell thinks - <b>I must stay committed with my friends in Hell</b>.

        <H3>Fate</H3>
        When a aprentice has a future planed, he make works about important subjects in freemansory. When he has nothing planed, he make works about minor subjects.
        <br>
        In Freemason, the most important rituals are made with 3 initiates. When they are three, it means that the Freemasons have grate plans for them.

        <h3>First Circle of Hell - Lust - You are a sex slave of the powerful and famous</h3>
        When a freemason becomes a worshipful master, he is a person of importance. His enemies want to humiliate him, so they make his wife sell herself and make lustful act with woman and man in exchange of money and fame.
        <br>
        <b>It is always a public scandal.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        To protect himself, the husband must make the same thing, but, he is going to be the buyer of sex with famous woman and man.

        <H3>Good vs Evil</H3>
        Is the human nature good or evil?
        <br>
        Heaven thinks that human nature is good.
        <br>
        Hell knowns that human nature is evil.
        <br>
        The human acts based on fear and hate.
        <br>
        To do good is a choice, a person must overcome his fear and hate to do good.
        <br>
        In conclusion, human nature is evil. To do good, one must overcome his nature.

        I had another dream where an old dying Freemason said the sentences bellow:
        <blockquote>
            When nothing is sin, nothing is taboo, nothing is illegal.
            <br>
            When your free-will is what decides what to do, not religion, not laws, not moral.
            <br>
            You are satanist.
        </blockquote>

        I am not old dying man, but for now I add:

        <blockquote>
            Reason. A satanist act based on reason, not emotions, not dogma.
        </blockquote>

        Since I was a child, there are additional lessons from Hell, usually not given:

        <blockquote>
            Always be sincere with yourself
        </blockquote>

        I made my desires to Hell and I was true to myself. As Hell always does, I received my desires in the worst way possible. Now, imagine if I had lied to myself.

        <blockquote>
            Always be responsible for your actions.
            <br>

         <H3>Egypt</H3>
         I will end up being in an Egyptian rite.

         <br>
         Pharaoh is more than and story, it is a Freemason rite.
         <br>
         At first I though this is the worst thing ever. Afterall god send the seven plagues to the Egypt. God kills your first born. It is the worst to be in a egyptian rite.
         <br>
         Then some old man said:
         <br>
         <i>- Where there is Egyptian constructions? How are the freemasons Egyptian Temples?</i>
         <br>
         - I said. The Egyptian Temple are the most luxurious I have ever seen. And Washington, D.C. is full of egyptian like monuments.
         <br>
         - Something is wrong. If God hates the egyptians, why are they the most luxurious?
         <br>
         <i>- The Egypt is our home. The followers of God go away with God. The old man said.</i>

         <blockquote>
            <b>Looks like that when the first faith test is a total failure, god anihilates the life of the neophyte and run away with his followers.</b>
            <br>
            <i>Then there is a second faith test.</i>
            <br>
            It is not an neopythe choice to be an egyptian. It happens when the first god is so deep in corruption schemes and god does not wants to fix or reconstruct the neophyte life.
            <br>
            The first god is forced to run away with its followers and leaves a trail of corruption and debt that must be dealt with.

        This is the pyramidal cubic stone. In this is the 3rd maçonic ritual. In this ritual, the freemasons try to kill the neophyte.

        <br>

        This creates a mental slave, usually the master controls the slave through <b>love</b>. The master abuses sexualy the slave, tortures him and demands love from the slave.
        The grater the love from the slave to its master the greater, the control over the slave.

        <H3>King or CICADA</H3>
        When the mental slave has nothing, there is no incentive to free the slave.
        <br>
        When the mental slave is something of importance, like the next king, there is a tremendous incentive be the master of slave.
        <br>
        But to change master, the slave must change the love of his life/mind.
        <br>
        The physical/mental/sexual abuses will become each time more violent as there is a battle to be the master of the slave.
        <br>
        One moment the King will lose all hope, lose all love, the slave will become a hateful, murderous king that will kill all his masters.
        <br>
        <b>The slave will become a Devil King</b>

        <H3>True love</H3>
        Another way is that the slave find a master that truely loves him and takes care of him and help him free his mind.
        <br>
        But everybody wants to have a king as a slave.
        <br>
        Only other queen that is also a mental slave or was a mental slave will be able to truly love him.
        <br>
        She has richies and was a mental slave, he has richies and is a mental slave.
        <br>
        Because she has already been in this position she will be able to have true compassion and true love the king that is a mental slave.

        <H2>Depressive Paranoid Schizophrenia</H2>

        In 1999 I began to free from my masters: Lígia Costa Toyama and Mario Ywagiro Toyama.
        <br>
        I began attending to a psychologist.
        <br>
        The doctor discovered that I was a mental slave, but instead of free my mind, the doctors became the next masters.
        <br>
        They convinced me that I am Depressive Paranoid Schizophrenia and was not a mental slave.
        <br>
        Because I was convinced that I was Depressive Paranoid Schizophrenia, I had 3 mental masters then: Lígia Costa Toyama and Mario Ywagiro Toyama who sexulay/physicall/mentally abused me my whole life. And the doctors who said I was not abused in any way, but I was delirious.

        CIA only extracts people on panic. People that want a new life and want to leave all behind. Leave family, friends, job, etc.
        <br>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama is not in panic. He knows that his life is in danger and that his life is going to be destroyed
        no matter what. Nevertheless, Marcelo Costa Toyama is always plotting against the Brazilian military.

        <H4>Project MKULTRA</H4>
        CIA knows what department of CIA is responsible for what is being done with the Marcelo Costa Toyama. It is the Project MKULTRA department. And the CIA hates this department.

        <H4>Fate</H4>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama was meant to be an USA - United States of America spy.
        <br>
        When a country destroys and important person, the CIA saves this person life.
        <br>
        As a result, the person works for the CIA forever.

        <H4>Cicada 3301</H4>
        Marcelo Costa Toyama was recruited by the CIA through the Cicada 3301. He fulfills the missions, but also does only what he wants in the process.

        <H3>Glenn Greenwald</H3>
        The voice said:
        - You want an investigative reporter to research about you. Do you like the Vaza Jato?
        <br>
        - Yes, it was good.
        <br>
        - What do you think about Glenn Greenwald?
        <br>
        - I guess he is good. Let me see. The Wikipedia says he won an award in the United States of America.
        <br>
        - If Glenn won an award in United States of America, why he migrate to Brazil? Well, he is a good report to research about me.
        <br>
        - Good.
        <br>
        <b>Some days/weeks/months after - the passage of time is really hard for me to track</b>
        <br>
        I was walking on parque da marinha in Porto Alegre RS with my father Mario Ywagiro Toyama and Lígia Costa Toyama. It was very early and there was nobody there.
        <br>
        Someone was walking in our direction. It was a young man. When he crossed our path, I heard the devil saying something like:
        <br>
        - Why so much makeup Glenn? You look too much younger!
        <br>
        <b>After this, I discovered that when I meet important people face to face, it opens games in my mind for them</b>
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - You should investigate the award that Glenn won on the United States of America, you are not going to be happy.
        <br>
        - He won an award for exposing the National Security Agency!!! ahahahahahha.
        <br>
        - The voices says that I stink Central Intelligence Agency, and I summoned Glenn to investigate me!! He should hate me!!!
        <br>
        - But the question remains.... Why did Glenn migrate to Brazil?
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - I known why Glenn migrate to Brazil. He exposed the National Security Agency; the United States of America must have made his life a living hell in the United States of America.
        <br>
        - I have the same problem, but on the other way around. The Brazilian Army make my life a living hell!!!
        <br>
        <b>Some months after</b>
        <br>
        - I discovered what is happening!!! I summoned the Glenn, the Central Intelligence Agency's favorite reporter to expose the Central Intelligence Agency in Brazil!!!
        <br>
        - Glenn has already exposed the National Security Agency in the United States of America, he knows how to work under the pressure of the high rank politicians and military!!
        <br>
        - The voices said that he is working on a news about corruption involving the United States of America and Central Intelligence Agency inside the Brazilian Army!!
